# test

Files in this folder are used only for testing the local handler.

## Config

The config files are used to properly replicate that filepaths setup that
local handler expects when creating a config provider.  We could replicate
the approach with a multiple buffered connector that simulates the files,
but it would not be a true test (I might do it in the future anyway.)
